Requirement for running the tests :
-----------------------------------

Birt requires to have a lot of libs in order to start.
The needed libs are stored in the Zip Maven archive :
http://maven.in.nuxeo.com/nexus/content/groups/internal-releases/org/eclipse/birt/birt-runtime-all/2.6.1/birt-runtime-all-2.6.1.zip

The maven build automatically add it to the jar, but to run the tests you will need to download manually the file and add it to the root of the resources directory.
